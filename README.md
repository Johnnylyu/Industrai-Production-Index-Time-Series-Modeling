## Industrai-Production-Index-Time-Series-Modeling

This is the project for Time Series Course in GWU.

Group Member: Austin Frazer, Shuwei Deng, Mengqi Li, Yinian Lyu

The project is focused on how to utilize the industrail production index given by the Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis
to do some explorations with Time Series Modeling in SAS.

Here is my responsiblity:
1. Visualized descriptive analysis and identified seasonality in the U.S. industrial production index with SAS
2. Iterated through various univariate Time Series model including exponential smoothing and ARIMA models
3. Estimated the trend of the index with transfer function model tuned by cross-correlations with an RMSE of 0.2509
